# Superstore Final Project ‚Äì Tableau Dashboard

This project was developed as the final project for the Data Analysis & Power BI track at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).  
It focuses on analyzing the popular Sample Superstore dataset using Tableau to extract actionable business insights through advanced data visualization techniques.

## üìà What I Did

1- I began by cleaning and preparing the data in Tableau, then created several KPI cards to display the total sales, profit, profit ratio, total quantity sold, and number of customers.  
Next, I explored sales performance and customer behavior by building a detailed report showing sales and profit per customer.

2- I used Tableau's forecasting tool to predict future sales trends, and created a **waterfall chart** to break down sales by sub-category.  
To make the comparison between product categories more engaging, I visualized sales with a **lollipop chart**, then created a side-by-side comparison of three selected categories.

3- After that, I converted the category comparison into a **data table**, calculated totals directly from it, and displayed both table and chart side-by-side for clarity.

4- I added an **interactive map** that shows profit and sales for each region with tooltips, and set it as a filter to make the dashboard dynamic.  
Then, I built a **donut chart** displaying total profit in "$K" and the percentage contribution of each region.

5- I also used **Tableau sets** to display the top and bottom profitable products in a single visual.  
For return analysis, I created a **line chart** showing the number of returned orders by sub-category.

6- To make the dashboard flexible, I built a **parameter** that allows switching between quantity, total sales, and total profit by sub-category.

7- Finally, I combined all visuals into two comprehensive dashboards:
- A product-focused dashboard
- An overview dashboard linking all charts

And I wrapped the project up with a **Tableau Story**, combining the forecast, lollipop chart, donut chart, and top/bottom insight for presentation.
